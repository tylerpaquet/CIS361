You've probably heard this one before, but it's so important that it's always worth repeating... There is a general rule that applies whenever we have a normal or bell-shaped distribution. Start with the average -- the center of the distribution. If you go up and down (i.e., left and right) one standard unit, you will include approximately 68% of the cases in the distribution (i.e., 68% of the area under the curve). If you go up and down two standard units, you will include approximately 95% of the cases. And if you go plus-and-minus three standard units, you will include about 99% of the cases. Notice that I didn't specify in the previous few sentences whether I was talking about standard deviation units or standard error units. That's because the same rule holds for both types of distributions (i.e., the raw data and sampling distributions). For instance, in the figure, the mean of the distribution is 3.75 and the standard unit is .25 (If this was a distribution of raw data, we would be talking in standard deviation units. If it's a sampling distribution, we'd be talking in standard error units). If we go up and down one standard unit from the mean, we would be going up and down .25 from the mean of 3.75. Within this range -- 3.5 to 4.0 -- we would expect to see approximately 68% of the cases. This section is marked in red on the figure. I leave to you to figure out the other ranges. But what does this all mean you ask? If we are dealing with raw data and we know the mean and standard deviation of a sample, we can predict the intervals within which 68, 95 and 99% of our cases would be expected to fall. We call these intervals the -- guess what -- 68, 95 and 99% confidence intervals.
